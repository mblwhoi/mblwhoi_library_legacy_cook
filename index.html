								<div id="img400"><img src="images/cook/cook1_thumb.jpg"></div><p class="description">At the behest of the Royal Society, London, and underwritten by John Montagu, the 4th Earl of Sandwich, James Cook set out on a series of three monumental voyages, between 1768-1780, to explore uncharted territories of the Pacific.  He was accompanied by noted naturalists (chief amongst whom was Sir Joseph Banks, FRS), astronomers, botanists, physicians and artists as well as a crew of 100 men (including William Bligh, later to become notorious as Captain of HMS Bounty.)  In addition Cooks small ships carried goats, sheep, two horn players, one bagpiper and a fife player.<br><br>
      					  Cooks's team of experts collected biological and botanical specimens, kept detailed written records and produced documentary drawings and maps from Tierra del Fuego to the northernmost regions of the Bering Straits.  Much of this data had never been reported to the Western world:  the novel and often anomalous specimens fueled a passion for taxonomy which was to become the main characteristic of 18th century science.<br><br>
      					  Cooks's expeditions were also the most profusely illustrated of any trips before the advent of photography.  This expedition focusses on the images produced by the artists on Cook's three voyages of exploration.  The show also celebrates a recent donation to the MBLWHOI Archives of the three volume "Account of Voyages to the Southn Hemisphere", 1773.  Many of the written descriptions have been taken verbatim from these eyewitness accounts.

								<p class="description">
								Born the son of a Yorkshire laborer, poorly educated and scientifically unsophisticated, by the time Cook met his untimely death he had been elected a Fellow of the Royal Society and was eulogized by the scientific elite of countries around the world.  Cook's life at sea began early.  He joined the Royal Navy at 17 and served in Canada where he charted the St. Lawrence River and surveyed the coasts of Labrador and Newfoundland.  He published his methods and findings in "Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society" and this publication put him on the academic map.<br><br>
      					He was chosen by the Admiralty to head the planned explorations of the Pacific, beating out more established professionals in the process.  The results of his four voyages were phenomenal.  The Pacific was opened up to exploration and commerce and Charles Darwin years later noted that Cook "helped to add a hemisphere to the civilized world."  Cook's written records and specimens transformed the Western world's image of nature and man, raised important issues in the field of taxonomy and led to the creation of anthropology as a new scientific discipline.<br><br>
      					In addition, Cook made a great contribution to medicine.  In 1853, James Lind, a Scottish physician, proposed that citrus fruit was a cure for scurvy, a disease that was a scourge of seamen, with the loss of 1/3 of a ship's crew not uncommon.  Cook decided to do a Phase II trial of Lind's hypothesis.  He mandated that the crew on his ship, the Endeavor, consume large quantities of raw sourkraut, a vegetable with an extremely high vitamin C content.  While unpalatable, not a single man was lost on this voyage.  Cook published a paper on his results and was awarded the prestigious Copley Medal from the Royal Society, catapulting him to the top of Britain's intellectual establishment.<br><br>
      					Cook died in the line of duty.  On the third, most arduous voyage to determine whether there was a northwest passage connecting America and Russia, Cook's ships returned to Hawaii for some necessary repairs.  A scuffle with hostile natives erupted, Cook was slain and his body was never recovered.  Rumor has it that he was eaten by cannibals.

									This portrait was painted the year that Britain lost her American colonies and the year James Cook set sail on the last of his three epic voyages to explore the Pacific, voyages that are among the great geographic and scientific adventures of all time.  Note Cook's chart of the Southern Hemisphere resting on his knee and his journal on the table.  The original painting is in the National Maritime Museum, London.<br><br>

  									<i>"There is a ceremony which they perform at or after the funerals of the dead...

  									Although the naive character of this drawing suggests "outsider art" the identity of the artist may be Joseph Banks.  He was one of three people on the ship Endeavor who had access to watercolor pigments and the other two were more interested in natural history drawings and taxonomy than portraiture.  Given Tahiti's voracious flies that <i>"ate the painters' colours off the papers as fast as it could be laid on,"</i>&nbsp; it is amazing that any drawings survive.<br><br>

Their faces were totaowed, or marked either all over, or on one side, in a very curious manner, some of them, in fine spiral directions, like a volute being indented in the skin very different from the rest."</i><br>October 12, 1769<br><br>
      									Parkinson's portraits of Maori warriors were the first visual record of the physiognomy, tattoo patterning, dress and ornament of the New Zealand natives.  This warrior chief is adorned with an ornamental comb, three feathers in a top-knot, a "heitiki" or amulet with a bone toggle hanging from his neck and a long pendant earring.  A similar heitiki was given to King George III by Cook and is now in the possession of Queen Elizabeth II.

        									This is a portrait of Otegoowgoow, the son of a chief of the Bay Islands, his face fully tatooed:  lines were cut in the skin with a blunt edged iron tool and then stained with an indelible mixture of soot and soil.  He wears greenstone ear pendants, a comb in his hair and a fish tooth around hi neck.  Both men and women were tatooed as a sign of social eminence and to disguise signs of aging.  Darvin commented on this New Zealand tradition in his Beagle Diary, December 1835:  <i>"One object of the tattowing is to prevent a change of features after middle age."</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;  One native woman commented, <i>"We really must just have a few lines on our lips; else when we grow old our lips will shrivel and we shall be so very ugly."</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;  One might consider this tattooing a premature form of cosmetic surgery.

Note the Aleut's unusual facial piercing:  bones draped with beads inserted in a deep slit beneath the lower lip.  <i>"This ornament, or labret, is a very great impediment to the speech and makes them look as if they had a double row of teeth."</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Teenagers today might consider such and ornament cool.

The priest...began to anoint the head of Cook with Cocoanut-oil infused with a milky juice that is obtained from the bread fruit.  This was succeeded by a long, uninterrupted oration...in a language almost verbally the same as at Otaheite and the other islands.  But the priest spoke so quickly we could not understand a word."</i><br><br>
                      									It is possible that the main course at the feast was roast dog, a local delicacy, which Cook described as <i>"next to English lamb in taste."</i><br><br>

                                    				And indeed the kangaroo took Europe by storm.  As a pouched marsupial, it sparked controversy amongst taxonomists as to how to accomodate new species into existing categories.  In addition the kangaroo captivated a lay audience:  the kangaroo dance, adapted from a maori ritual, swept Europe and had a lasting effect.  As late as 1975 the Kangaroo Hop was danced by Gene Wilder, Madeline Kahn and Marty Feldman in the film "The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes' Smarter Brother."
